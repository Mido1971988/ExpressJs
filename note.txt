Express : 
    - is a framework for node js
    - Steps :
        [1] npm i express
        [2] const express = require("express")
        [3] const app = express();
        [4] app has alot of methods like ( get , listen , ...)
    - express accepts regular expression like ("^/$|/index(.html)?") in app.get()
    - Express handle 404 page automatically

* custom 404 Page : 
    [1] app.get("/*",callback) /* means any page did not mention in code
    [2] res.status(404).sendFile(path.join(__dirname , "views" , "404.html")) inside callback function
        we added status(404) because without it the status will be 200 

* Route Hanlder 
    you can add 3rd parameter ( next ) so ypu can chain callback function and will invoke next callback when you write next()
    you can chain callback function in array like this ( app.get("/chain(.html)?" , [one , two , three]) )

* Middleware 
    - anything between request and response
    - there are 3 types : 
        [1] built-in 
            (a) app.use(express.json)
            (b) app.use(express.static(path.join(__dirname, "/public" ))) without it you can cannot link css or images to html file
            (c) app.use(express.urlencoded({ extended: false})) // add before all routes so will be availabe for them
        [2] custom 
            like // custom Middleware logger in server.js
        [3] from 3rd party
            like // 3rd party Middleware cors in server.js
